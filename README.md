## What is ASOM?

ASOM (Agentic Scrum Operating Model) is a framework for autonomous software development in data engineering, combining:

- 🤖 **Five specialized agent roles** (BA, Dev, QA, Governance, Scrum Master)
- ✅ **Test-Driven Development** as fundamental practice (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- 📋 **PDL Governance** integrated into workflow ("Mapping Not Duplication")
- 🔄 **Scrum methodology** with 2-week sprints
- 🎯 **Production-ready quality** with complete audit trail

**Use ASOM when you need:**
- Regulatory compliance (GDPR, SOX, HIPAA)
- Audit-ready documentation
- High-quality, tested code
- Clear governance boundaries
- Autonomous AI-driven development

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Get the Framework

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asom-framework.git
cd asom-framework
```

### 2. Your First Sprint

Follow the [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) guide to build your first customer data pipeline with complete PDL governance in 10 days.

**What you'll build:**
- Extract customer data from REST API
- Mask PII (email, phone) for GDPR compliance
- Load to Snowflake with access controls
- Complete all PDL artefacts (100%)
- Deploy to production with governance certification

### 3. Read the Philosophy

See [ASOM.md](ASOM.md) to understand the core principles and why TDD + PDL governance enable autonomous development.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Agentic Role Separation

Work is divided among five specialized agent roles, each with clear responsibilities:

| Agent | Primary Responsibility | PDL Artefacts |
|-------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Business Analyst** | Requirements, stories | Risk Registry, Charter, Roadmap |
| **Developer** | Implementation (TDD) | Architecture Handbook, ITOH |
| **QA** | Testing, validation | Test Evidence (IQ/OQ/PQ), Traceability |
| **Governance** | PDL Gatekeeper | Security/Privacy Assessments, Gate Reviews |
| **Scrum Master** | Coordination, tracking | PDL task tracking, Sprint reports |

Each agent has:
- Defined decision-making frameworks
- Clear handoff protocols
- Specific skills to reference
- Quality standards

### 2. Test-Driven Development (Fundamental)

**TDD is mandatory in ASOM** - not optional:

```
RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
```

1. **RED**: Write failing test first (defines requirements)
2. **GREEN**: Write minimum code to pass (implements requirements)  
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality (maintains standards)

**Why TDD is fundamental:**
- Requirements clarity (tests force precise criteria)
- Quality by design (can't mark "done" without tests)
- Regression prevention (refactoring is safe)
- Governance evidence (tests prove controls work)
- Autonomous confidence (safety net for AI agents)

### 3. PDL Governance ("Mapping Not Duplication")

**Project Documentation List (PDL)** = regulatory/audit artefacts required for compliance

**Core Principle:** Demonstrate controls exist via code, tests, and tools - don't create redundant documentation.

Every PDL item must be:
- **Produced** - Generated by SDLC process
- **Referenced** - Exists in corporate system
- **Not Applicable** - Explicitly justified exemption

**PDL Workflow:**
1. Governance performs PDL Impact Assessment at epic creation
2. Creates tracking tasks (T001-T00N) assigned to appropriate agents
3. Agents complete PDL tasks throughout sprint
4. Governance validates 100% PDL completion before QA/PROD deployment
5. Blocks deployment if PDL incomplete

**PDL Categories:**

| Category | ASOM Mapping | Examples |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Initiation & Governance | Epic, Risk Registry | Charter, Roadmap |
| Architecture & Security | Confluence docs | Architecture Handbook, Security Assessments |
| Requirements | User Stories | Acceptance Criteria (Functional Spec) |
| Testing | Test execution | IQ/OQ/PQ evidence, Traceability Matrix |
| Release | Change Request | CRQ records |
| Operations | Runbooks | ITOH, Monitoring procedures |

See [PDL-REFERENCE.md](PDL-REFERENCE.md) for complete workflow.

### 4. Scrum Methodology

Standard Scrum practices:
- 2-week sprints with clear goals
- Daily coordination (async via issue tracker)
- Sprint planning, review, retrospective
- Definition of Ready and Definition of Done
- PDL tracking integrated into backlog

### 5. Governance by Default

Every story includes:
- PII protection requirements
- Audit trail implementation
- Access control specifications
- Data retention policies
- Test requirements (IQ/OQ evidence)

Governance is not an afterthought - it's built into acceptance criteria from the start.

---

## Typical Story Lifecycle

```
1. Epic Created (Product Owner)
   └─ Governance Agent: PDL Impact Assessment
      ├─ Identifies 6 PDL items impacted
      └─ Creates PDL tasks T001-T006, assigns to agents

2. BA Agent: Creates Stories
   ├─ Story S001-S005 with acceptance criteria
   ├─ Includes test requirements (TDD)
   └─ Handles T001 (Risk Registry update)

3. Dev Agent: Implements with TDD
   ├─ RED: Writes failing tests
   ├─ GREEN: Implements to pass tests
   ├─ REFACTOR: Improves code quality
   ├─ Handles T002 (Architecture Handbook)
   └─ Handles T006 (ITOH update)

4. QA Agent: Validates
   ├─ Verifies TDD process followed
   ├─ Executes all tests
   ├─ Validates data quality thresholds
   ├─ Handles T005 (OQ test evidence)
   └─ Generates traceability matrix

5. Governance Agent: Completes Own Tasks
   ├─ T003 (Security Assessment)
   └─ T004 (Privacy Impact Assessment)

6. Governance Agent: QA Gate Review
   ├─ Validates PDL 100% complete
   ├─ Checks all governance controls tested
   ├─ DECISION: APPROVE or HOLD
   └─ If approved → Deploy to QA

7. QA Deployment
   └─ System deployed to QA environment

8. Governance Agent: PROD Gate Review
   ├─ Re-validates PDL completeness
   ├─ Confirms PROD-specific items (CRQ, etc.)
   ├─ DECISION: APPROVE or REJECT
   └─ If approved → Deploy to PROD

9. Story Complete
   └─ Status: Done (100% PDL, all tests passing)
```

**Key Insight:** PDL tasks are created at epic start and completed throughout the sprint, NOT as a last-minute scramble.

---

## Agent Handoffs

Clear handoff protocols ensure smooth flow:

```
BA → Governance:    Story refined, needs governance review
Governance → Dev:   Story approved, ready for development
Dev → QA:           PR created, needs testing
QA → Governance:    Tests passing, needs governance certification
Governance → QA:    PDL complete, approved for QA deployment
QA → Governance:    QA validated, needs PROD approval
Governance → Done:  PROD approved, compliance certified
```

**Workflow States:**
```
backlog → refined → ready → in-progress → in-review → 
testing → governance-review → done
```

---

## Framework Evolution

### Version Management

Each project references a framework version:

```markdown
# In project README.md
ASOM Framework: v1.0.0
```

### Framework Updates

**Update process:**
1. Retrospective identifies improvements
2. Update framework repository (agents/, skills/)
3. Tag new version: `git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Release v1.1.0"`
4. Projects adopt new version when ready

**Versioning:**
- Major (v2.0.0): Breaking changes to agent/skill contracts
- Minor (v1.1.0): New skills, enhanced agents
- Patch (v1.0.1): Bug fixes, clarifications

---

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- **Create PDL tasks at epic start** - Don't wait until end
- **Write tests first** - RED → GREEN → REFACTOR always
- **Distribute PDL work** - BA/Dev/QA handle their artefacts
- **Block deployment if PDL incomplete** - Governance enforces 100%
- **Keep feature branches short-lived** - 1-3 days maximum
- **Commit often with meaningful messages** - Conventional format
- **Review your own code first** - Before creating PR
- **Track PDL completeness daily** - Prevent surprises at gates

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't write code before tests** - Breaks TDD discipline
- **Don't let Governance do all PDL** - Distribute to appropriate agents
- **Don't skip PDL to "go faster"** - Will block deployment anyway
- **Don't commit secrets** - Use environment variables
- **Don't update audit records** - Append-only, immutable
- **Don't expose PII in curated layer** - Always masked/redacted
- **Don't merge without tests passing** - Quality gate

---

## Troubleshooting

### "PDL tasks blocking sprint completion"

**Cause:** PDL tasks created too late or ignored during sprint

**Solution:**
- Create PDL tasks during epic creation (Day 1)
- Track PDL completeness daily
- Flag PDL tasks >24 hours old
- Governance escalates blockers early

### "Tests written after code"

**Cause:** Dev Agent not following TDD discipline

**Solution:**
- QA Agent checks commit history for TDD pattern
- Reject PR if tests not written first
- Reinforce TDD in retrospective
- Pair programming to learn TDD

### "Too many governance violations"

**Cause:** Governance requirements not in acceptance criteria

**Solution:**
- BA includes governance in every story
- Governance reviews stories before "ready"
- Create governance checklist template
- Automate governance tests

### "Slow agent handoffs"

**Cause:** Unclear handoff criteria or missing context

**Solution:**
- Review handoff protocols in retrospective
- Add handoff checklist to workflow states
- Improve story context and acceptance criteria
- Better agent-to-agent communication
