Agent-Assisted Delivery for Regulated Data Platforms

Slide 1 — Title & Decision Context

Title
ASOM v2: Agent-Assisted Delivery Under Enterprise Controls

Subtitle
Enabling AI-accelerated delivery without weakening governance

Decision Requested
Approval to run a controlled ASOM v2 pilot (30–60–90 days)

⸻

Slide 2 — The Problem We Are Solving

Current Reality
	•	Delivery velocity and governance are in tension
	•	AI assistance is increasing, but controls lag behind
	•	Manual compliance creates friction and audit risk
	•	Existing SDLCs do not scale to data-platform change velocity

Risk
	•	Either governance erodes
	•	Or delivery slows to a crawl

⸻

Slide 3 — Why Naïve Agentic AI Is Not Acceptable

Observed Risks
	•	Self-approval loops
	•	Fabricated or narrative “evidence”
	•	Weak separation of duties
	•	Audit exposure
	•	Tool-centric rather than control-centric designs

Conclusion

Autonomous AI delivery is incompatible with regulated enterprise environments.

⸻

Slide 4 — ASOM v2 Positioning

What ASOM v2 Is
	•	An agent-assisted delivery operating model
	•	Designed for regulated cloud data platforms
	•	Built around controls, evidence, and gates

What ASOM v2 Is Not
	•	Autonomous deployment
	•	A replacement for Jira, ServiceNow, or CI/CD
	•	A governance shortcut

Core Principle

Agents assist. Systems enforce. Humans approve.

⸻

Slide 5 — Operating Model (One Slide)

Roles
	•	Humans: approve, deploy, own accountability
	•	Agents: draft, analyse, surface gaps
	•	Systems: enforce gates and produce evidence

Flow

DEV → QA → PROD
      ↑       ↑
 Human approval (ServiceNow)

Key Constraint
	•	Exactly one CRQ per release

⸻

Slide 6 — Governance Spine (Why Audit Says Yes)

ASOM v2 Enforces
	•	Explicit control objectives
	•	Machine-generated evidence
	•	Immutable evidence ledger
	•	Deterministic promotion gates
	•	Technical separation of duties

No Reliance On
	•	Screenshots
	•	Emails
	•	Narrative compliance
	•	Trust in individuals or agents

⸻

Slide 7 — How a Change Is Governed (Lifecycle View)
	1.	Scope defined in Jira
	2.	Code + tests executed in CI/CD
	3.	Evidence generated automatically
	4.	Gates evaluate controls
	5.	Human approvals recorded in ServiceNow
	6.	Promotion allowed or blocked deterministically

Result
	•	Failures surface early
	•	Remediation is explicit
	•	Audit trail is complete by default

⸻

Slide 8 — Evidence & Auditability

Evidence Characteristics
	•	Machine-generated
	•	Traceable to commit, build, CRQ
	•	Stored in authoritative systems
	•	Indexed via Evidence Ledger

Audit Capability

Any production release can be audited end-to-end from system records alone.

⸻

Slide 9 — Risk Management & Failure Containment

Known Failure Modes Explicitly Addressed
	•	Hallucinated compliance
	•	Agent overreach
	•	Approval bypass
	•	Evidence reuse
	•	Silent data drift
	•	Cost regressions

Design Outcome

ASOM v2 fails safe — by blocking promotion.

⸻

Slide 10 — Pilot Proposal (30–60–90 Days)

30 Days
	•	Shadow mode
	•	No enforcement
	•	Evidence generation only

60 Days
	•	QA gate enforced
	•	Human approvals required
	•	One real release

90 Days
	•	PROD gate enforced
	•	Full audit walkthrough
	•	Scale / stop decision

Key Point
	•	Pilot is reversible at any point

⸻

Slide 11 — What Approval Enables

Approval Does NOT
	•	Replace existing SDLC
	•	Automate approvals
	•	Change ITSM ownership
	•	Introduce vendor lock-in

Approval DOES
	•	Allow a controlled pilot
	•	Reduce audit friction
	•	Improve delivery predictability
	•	Establish safe AI usage patterns

⸻

Slide 12 — Decision & Next Steps

Decision Requested
	•	Approve ASOM v2 pilot
	•	Nominate one pilot team
	•	Nominate one governance partner
	•	Review outcomes at Day 90

Success Criteria
	•	No increase in risk
	•	Clear audit traceability
	•	Acceptable delivery friction
	•	Leadership confidence to scale (or stop)
